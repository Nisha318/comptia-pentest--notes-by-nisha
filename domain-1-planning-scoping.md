# Domain 1: Planning and Scoping




## Activity 1.1: Adopting the Hacker Mindset
Before we dive into the many technical examples throughout this book, let's try an example of applying the hacker mindset to everyday life.

Think about the grocery store where you normally shop. What are some of the security measures used by that store to prevent the theft of cash and merchandise? What ways can you think of to defeat those controls?

### Security measures commonly used in grocery stores:

Surveillance cameras
Security guards or loss prevention officers
Electronic article surveillance (EAS) tags on high-value items
Locked cases for expensive products (e.g. alcohol, electronics)
Cash register controls and reconciliation procedures
Limited access to stockrooms and offices
Security mirrors in corners
Automatic locking mechanisms on emergency exits


### Potential ways these controls could potentially be defeated. 

Camera blind spots: Identify areas not covered by cameras.
Social engineering: Impersonating staff or vendors to gain access to restricted areas.
Tailgating: Following authorized personnel into restricted areas.
Tag removal or shielding: Removing EAS tags or using foil-lined bags to block signals.
Exploiting busy times: Taking advantage of high-traffic periods when staff are distracted.
Insider threats: Collusion with employees.
Lock picking or key duplication: Gaining unauthorized access to locked areas or cases.
Cash register exploits: Taking advantage of shift changes or distractions during transactions.
Dumpster diving: Gathering information from discarded receipts or documents.
Exploiting emergency procedures: Using fire alarms or other emergencies as a distraction.

This exercise demonstrates how a "hacker mindset" involves looking at systems creatively, identifying potential weaknesses, and thinking about how controls might be bypassed. In cybersecurity, this type of thinking helps in identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities before malicious actors can exploit them.
